# [Mass effect Codex](https://bilostenko.github.io/MassEffect/sandbox.html) is the result of the gaming experience of the Mass Effect trilogy and the desire to stop constantly remembering who is who.

This project was made by using:
- HTML
- SCSS
- JavaScript
- [API](https://github.com/cvines528/mass-effect-api)

The application is adapted to any device screen ( using `calc()` and `@media` )

**NOTE** *Some images may not load. This is not due to an error in my code. The problem occures on [API](https://github.com/cvines528/mass-effect-api) itself*
